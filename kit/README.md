This project is made on After Effects CC 2017 and comes with two types of compositions; WORKING and OUTPUT. The pixel space of the Working compositions is 16x larger than the actual output. This allows you to create on a reasonable size.

**OUTPUT COMP**

Once you are done with Working on the creative side, you can output your work from two options:

1. Harpa2018_template_OUTPUT_Visualizer (this render can be used for the online visualiser)
2. Harpa2018_template_OUTPUT_System (this is the render for the system, your delivery format)

I recommend that you duplicate the render settings for each output. And voila!

## Controls

The controls will be 2 joysticks and 4 arcade buttons and are yours to use in whichever way you deem fit. We will take care of transmitting control messages to your application.

W, A, S, D (joystick 1 up/left/down/right)
I, J, K, L (joystick 2 up/left/down/right)
Q, E (2 generic buttons mounted next to joystick 1 )
U, O (2 generic buttons mounted next to joystick 2 )
0 (Important: this button (numpad 0) should reset the game state.)

## Tips and Tricks

1. Keep it bold and simple. Detailed visuals might lose against pixel art for example.
2. The video content on a building this big might appear faster, be modest with the speed.
3. Negative space is the key, the more black and contrast, the better the look.
4. Using audio to animate will help compensate the lack of pixels. Beat the beat.
