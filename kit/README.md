These documents are provided for the super curious + detail oriented, they are intended mainly to show exactly how the lights are laid out on the buildings.

PAY NO ATTENTION TO THE CODES ON THE DIAGRAMS - they are for us to worry about, and some of them are wrong anyway.

ALSO NOTE - our 77 x 13 mapping does miss out some small rows, and one or two individual lights at the edges. They will remain black.

It is worth taking note of how the different 'pixels' of the facade are arranged relative to each other, i.e. they are not in a regular straight grid.

If in doubt, stick to the 77 x 13 grid.

In detail, from your app's perspective:

0,0 is the top-left light on the small facade
37,8 is the right-hand light on the lowest row on the small facade. (E3/S12/U5/46 on the overview cableing south facade small-a.pdf document)

38,0 is unmapped (because the light there doesn't exist)
38,1 is the top light on the left-most row on the large facade (E2/S10/U4/151 on the overview cableing facade south large-b.pdf document)
76,12 is actually unmapped (because the light there doesn't exist)
76,10 is the bottom-right light on the second-to-last row (E1/S1/U1/13 on overview cableing facade south large-b.pdf document)

### After Effects

[AfterEffectsHarpaTemplate](AfterEffects/HarpaTemplate.aep)

This project is made on After Effects CC 2017 There are two types of compositions in this project:
WORKING compositions and OUTPUT Compositions
The pixel space of the Working Compositions is 16 times larger than the actual Output.
This allows you to work on a reasonable size (Not too small)
