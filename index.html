        <h4>Technical specifications</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Resolution Left Facade: 38x33px</li>
            <li>Resolution Right Facade: 39x9px</li>
            <li>Video Length: 2-10 minutes</li>

        </ul>
        <h4>We welcome submissions that fit the following criteria</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Work that emphasises a close relationship between image and sound</li>
            <li>Interactive experiences that invite audience participation</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Please note</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Due to the tiny resolution but massive size of Harpa it's important to be very considerate of contrast and pace. Subtle gradients that may be visible on a computer monitor will likely not present well on the building.</li>
            <li>Make use of the unique fact that Harpa has two facades with unique designs and resolutions.</li>
