		<p><a href="http://nava.team/">Nordic Audiovisual Artists</a> presents Tiny Massive, a series of architectural interventions where monumental structures are transformed into a creative canvas of light.</p>

		<section id="open-call">
			<p><em>Winter Lights Festival 2019<br>7th — 10th February</em></p>
			<p>For the very first edition of Tiny Massive you are invited to illuminate Harpa concert hall during <a href="http://www.winterlightsfestival.is/">Reykjavik Winter Lights Festival</a>. We are looking for work that cultivates a meaningful connection among people or between individuals and structures. You are encouraged to draw inspiration from the architecture of Harpa and the raw nature that surrounds it. You can apply either with video content or generative / interactive / game experiences. The selected few will be displayed during the festival.</p>

			<h2>FAQ</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>If my work is selected, will I receive any monetary compensation?</strong>
                <span>No. However, three outstanding works will receive a travel grant to come to Reykjavik during the event.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Can I apply with multiple works?</strong>
                <span>Yes! Apply with as many contributions as you wish, there's no limit!</span>
            </p>
			<p>
				<strong>Can I apply as a team?</strong>
				<span>Yes!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Can I use a different controller for my game/interactive piece?</strong>
				<span>If there is a strong reason for it, and we can practically accomodate the controller, then.. maybe. We'd really prefer entries to focus on the building and creative ways of working with the limited resolution.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>What colour range does each light on Harpa have?</strong>
				<span>Each light has 3 x 8-bit channels for Red, Green and Blue, giving a range of 0-255, or 24-bit colour.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>What's with the 30fps frame rate, can't we go higher?</strong>
				<span>The lights are controlled by DMX, and there's a limit to how much data we can send at any one time. If only part of the image changes, we may be able to get a higher refresh rate, but if you're strobing the entire facade, we can only send frames at 30fps.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>I have no experience with either code or video, can I still apply?</strong>
				<span>We have found that the best pieces doesn't necessarily come from "professionals", give it your best go! It's almost impossible to fail with Harpa as a canvas :)</span>
