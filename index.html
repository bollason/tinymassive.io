			<h2>Open call #1</h2>
			<p><em>Winter Lights Festival 2019<br>7th — 10th February</em></p>
			<p>For the very first edition of Tiny Massive you are invited to illuminate Harpa concert hall during <a href="http://www.winterlightsfestival.is/">Reykjavik Winter Lights Festival</a>. We are looking for work that cultivates a meaningful connection among people or between individuals and structures. You are encouraged to draw inspiration from the architecture of Harpa and the raw nature that surrounds it. You can apply either with video content or generative/interactive/game experiences. The selected works will be displayed during the festival.</p>

			<h3>Apply</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Application deadline: 16th of December 2018, 24:00 CET</li>
				<li><a href="https://goo.gl/forms/3H5Fq7omWalWrx252" target="_blank">Application form</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Please <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/tiny-massive/shared_invite/enQtNDY1MjQwMjY4NzY4LTlhZDgxZTJmZDIxOTQ0MDY5Y2I1MWQ0MDYyMjEyMmVlNGFiNDNhMTlmMmEyNzEwMTI3YWRjNzJhMzkzZGIzNjk">join our Slack</a> for creative discussions around your idea. We have lots of experience and are willing to help make your contribution the best it can be!</p>
			<h4>Technical specifications - video</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Resolution Left Facade: 39x9px</li>
				<li>Resolution Right Facade: 38x13px</li>
				<li>Resolution Total: 77x13px</li>
				<li>Video Length: 2-5 minutes</li>
				<li>Video encoding: Uncompressed</li>
				<li>Video format: Quicktime</li>
				<li>Sound: Optional, but highly recommended</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Interactive/generative works</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Resolution - as above. <br/>(Applications can display graphics outside of this area, e.g. a scaled up version for debugging.)</li>
				<li>Delivery format: either macOS 10.11+ executable, or self-contained web app, compatible with Chrome.</li>
				<li>Application window should appear at 0,0 on launch</li>
				<li>Interactive works should have a 'cycle' of interaction less than 2 minutes</li>
				<li>If your work is a game, you should clearly acknowledge the 'end state'</li>
				<li>We will be providing template projects for Unity and HTML/JS apps in the coming weeks.</li>
			</ul>
			<b>Interaction</b>
			<ul>
				<li>We will be providing controls, in a sheltered location opposite Harpa (likely outside the Central Bank building) for interactive works.</li>
				<li>The controls will be two joysticks, and 4 generic arcade buttons, located in pairs next to each joystick.</li>
				<li>We will take care of transmitting control messages to your application. You should listen out for the following key presses:
					<ul>
						<li><code>W, A, S, D</code> (joystick 1 up/left/down/right)</li>
						<li><code>I, J, K, L</code> (joystick 2 up/left/down/right)</li>
						<li><code>Q, E, U, O</code> (4 generic buttons)</li>
						<li><code>0 </code> (Important: this button should reset the game state.)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

		<!-- 	

			<p>For games / interactive content we expect a Mac app that runs and displays graphics in the correct resolution. It's also possible to provide a Touch Designer file, ask in the Slack channel for more info.</p> -->
			
			<!-- <h4>Please note</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Due to the tiny resolution but massive size of Harpa it's important to be very considerate of contrast and pace. Subtle gradients that may be visible on a computer monitor will likely not present well on the building.</li>
				<li>Make use of the unique fact that Harpa has two facades with unique designs and resolutions.</li>
				<li>While the final resolution is tiny, you can easily work in 10x or 20x to have an easier time designing.</li>
				<li>There is no monetary reward for having your work selected. What you get in return is some great documentation and an extraordinary canvas to present your work on. We will of course make sure to post all the selected works and artists online.</li>
