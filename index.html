			<h2>Open call #1</h2>
			<p><em>Winter Lights Festival 2019<br>7th — 10th February</em></p>
			<p>For the very first edition of Tiny Massive you are invited to illuminate Harpa concert hall during <a href="http://www.winterlightsfestival.is/">Reykjavik Winter Lights Festival</a>. We are looking for work that cultivates a meaningful connection among people or between individuals and structures. You are encouraged to draw inspiration from the architecture of Harpa and the raw nature that surrounds it. You can apply either with video content or generative/interactive/game experiences. The selected works will be displayed during the festival.</p>

			<h3>Technical specifications</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Left facade: 39x9px</li>
				<li>Right facade: 38x13px</li>
				<li>Total resolution: 77x13px</li>
				<li>Frame rate: 30fps</li>
				<li>Sound: Optional, but highly recommended</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Video</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Video Length: 2-5 minutes</li>
				<li>Video encoding: Uncompressed</li>
				<li>Video format: Quicktime</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Generative/interactive/game</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Delivery format: Either macOS 10.11+ executable, or self-contained web app, compatible with Chrome.</li>
				<li>Application window should appear at 0,0 on launch</li>
				<li>Interactive works should have a 'cycle' of interaction less than 2 minutes</li>
				<li>If your work is a game, you should clearly acknowledge the 'end state'</li>
				<li>We will be providing template projects for Unity and HTML/JS apps in the 'Creator Kit'.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We will be providing controls in a sheltered location opposite Harpa for interactive works. The controls will be <strong>2 joysticks and 4 arcade buttons</strong>. We will take care of transmitting control messages to your application.</p>
			<p><img src="./assets/controller-diagram.png"></p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>W, A, S, D</code> (joystick 1 up/left/down/right)</li>
				<li><code>I, J, K, L</code> (joystick 2 up/left/down/right)</li>
				<li><code>Q, E</code> (2 generic buttons mounted next to joystick 1 )</li>
				<li><code>U, O</code> (2 generic buttons mounted next to joystick 2 )</li>
				<li><code>0 </code> (Important: this button should reset the game state.)</li>
			</ul>
		<!-- <p>For games / interactive content we expect a Mac app that runs and displays graphics in the correct resolution. It's also possible to provide a Touch Designer file, ask in the Slack channel for more info.</p> -->
			
			<!-- <h4>Please note</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Due to the tiny resolution but massive size of Harpa it's important to be very considerate of contrast and pace. Subtle gradients that may be visible on a computer monitor will likely not present well on the building.</li>
				<li>Make use of the unique fact that Harpa has two facades with unique designs and resolutions.</li>
				<li>While the final resolution is tiny, you can easily work in 10x or 20x to have an easier time designing.</li>
				<li>There is no monetary reward for having your work selected. What you get in return is some great documentation and an extraordinary canvas to present your work on. We will of course make sure to post all the selected works and artists online.</li>

			<h3>FAQ</h3>
			<p>For questions not answered in this FAQ, please write in our <a href="https://tiny-massive.slack.com/">Slack</a>.</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Can I apply as a team?</strong>
				<span>Yes!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Can I use a different controller for my game/interactive piece?</strong>
				<span>If there is a strong reason for it, and we can practically accomodate the controller, then.. maybe. We'd really prefer entries to focus on the building and creative ways of working with the limited resolution.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>What colour range does each light on Harpa have?</strong>
				<span>Each light has 3 x 8-bit channels for Red, Green and Blue, giving a range of 0-255, or 24-bit colour.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>What's with the 30fps frame rate, can't we go higher?</strong>
				<span>The lights are controlled by DMX, and there's a limit to how much data we can send at any one time. If only part of the image changes, we may be able to get a higher refresh rate, but if you're strobing the entire facade, we can only send frames at 30fps.</span>
