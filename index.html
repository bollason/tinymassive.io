            <p><em>Winter Lights Festival 2019<br>7th â€” 10th February</em></p>
            <p>For the very first edition of Tiny Massive you are invited to illuminate the Harpa concert hall during the Reykjavik Winter Lights Festival. We are looking for work that draws inspiration from the architecture of Harpa and the raw nature that surrounds it.</p>
            <p>You can apply with either <em>video</em> or <em>generative / interactive experiences</em> and the selected works will be displayed during the festival between 18.00-24.00.</p>

            <p>Please <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/tiny-massive/shared_invite/enQtNDY1MjQwMjY4NzY4LTlhZDgxZTJmZDIxOTQ0MDY5Y2I1MWQ0MDYyMjEyMmVlNGFiNDNhMTlmMmEyNzEwMTI3YWRjNzJhMzkzZGIzNjk">join our Slack</a> for creative discussions around your idea. We have lots of experience creating content for the building and are willing to make your contribution the best it can be!</p>
            <h4>Please note</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Due to the tiny resolution but massive size of Harpa it's important to be very considerate of contrast and pace. Subtle gradients that may be visible on a computer monitor will likely not present well on the building.</li>
                <li>Make use of the unique fact that Harpa has two facades with unique designs and resolutions.</li>
                <li>While the final resolution is tiny, you can easily work in 10x or 20x to have an easier time designing.</li>
